Journal Encryptor and Decryptor

This is a personal project created by Marty Brandwein to encrypt and decrypt journal entries. The personal key definition has been ommitted for my security. Obviously, this is not an actually secure encryption method, especially with the encryption code provided, but I am currently bored and want a small personal project that I can actually use for myself.
